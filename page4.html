                    <span>Green architecture is a great solution to air pollution and can be quickly applied to already existing buildings.  This would be a great option for quick implementation. Not only would green architecture make strides in overcoming air pollution, it would also help improve mental defects as shown above, and provide a yard-like environment for those who donâ€™t have the land possible for a traditional yard. If solutions are not pushed for, air pollution will only continue to get worse and the effects it has will also worsen. Therefore, it is important that people do what they can to decrease its effects and green architecture is one of the more simple and quickly implementable solutions. Possible ways to try and encourage more green architecture is sending letters to your local political leaders as they are in a position to push for it in legislature. Another way is to spread the word amongst those you know and on social media to try and get it to trend and increase how common it is.
