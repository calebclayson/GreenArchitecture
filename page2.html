                    <span>
                        While it is pretty obvious that air pollution is detremental to people's physical health. Air pollution also has an effect on people’s mental state. For kids, who haven’t fully developed brains, it can inflame their brains. This inflammation is similar to the inflammation that happens in brains with anxiety and depression (<a href="https://doi-org.ezproxy.uvu.edu/10.1186/s12889-019-6733-1">Midouhas</a>). With these kinds of issues becoming more and more common, it seems like air pollution only makes these conditions worse. If pollution was dealt with more effectively, it could hopefully also help deal with the issues of anxiety and depression. <a href="https://doi-org.ezproxy.uvu.edu/10.1186/s12889-019-6733-1">Mindouhas</a> also claimed, “...children exposed to air pollutants, either in the prenatal or in the postnatal period, are at greater risk of behavioral problems, a diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and being prescribed medication for psychiatric disorders.” This study shows that effects from air pollution were found to be minimal at this point (<a href="https://doi-org.ezproxy.uvu.edu/10.1186/s12889-019-6733-1">Midouhas</a>). However, the study goes on to show that if air pollution continues to be left alone, it could become dense to the point where it does have a significant effect on mental health beyond the already present health issues.
