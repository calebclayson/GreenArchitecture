                            Air pollution has been an issue for quite a while. As air quality continues to worsen, it doesn’t seem like the conversation about it becomes more active. While the air in many places is passable, there are many people who live in big cities in which the pollution there is dangerous to their health. Beijing has a massive smog problem and has a very high population. This is also true for cities such as San Francisco, New York, and Salt Lake City. Green architecture is a great solution to air pollution because it effectively decreases pollutants in the air, can have a positive effect on people’s mental state, and reduces health problems where implemented.
