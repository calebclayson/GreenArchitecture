                    <span>Green architecture is a great way to combat air pollution. According to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.05.014">Abhijith</a>, green roofs can effectively decrease pollutants in both street canyons, which are tightly packed environments without much space between buildings, and open roads. Green roofs, which are a type of green architecture, work well no matter the amount of buildings. This is shown by the fact that street canyons and open roads are opposites when it comes to building density. Street canyons are tightly packed highly urban areas. While open roads are long stretches of road without any or very little buildings. This means that green roofs can be quite adaptable depending on what environment the green roof is needed in. <a href="http://search.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.uvu.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=edb&AN=127747022&site=eds-live">DIMITRIJEVIĆ</a> states, “Green roofs improve urban air quality and by extension public health and quality of life”. This further supports that green roofs are effective in improving air quality and they could possibly even help deal with the mental and physical problems mentioned earlier.</span>
